# Magic-8-Ball game
Let's implement idea of a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking (Using Control Flow skills and Random library)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-ball

To do this, we need to write Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.
We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

⦁	Yes - definitely.
⦁	It is decidedly so.
⦁	Without a doubt.
⦁	Reply hazy, try again.
⦁	Ask again later.
⦁	Better not tell you now.
⦁	My sources say no.
⦁	Outlook not so good.
⦁	Very doubtful.
⦁	oh yup baby
⦁	Hm, nice question
The output of the program will have the following format:

[Name] asks: [Question]
Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]
For example:

Joe asks: Is this real life?
Magic 8-Ball's answer: Better not tell you now
Let’s get started!

Also i tried to cover cases when not provided name or question, or both entities.

Feel free to improve this game ;))
